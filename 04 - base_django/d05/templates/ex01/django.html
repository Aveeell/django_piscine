<h1>About the Django Software Foundation</h1>
<p>
Development of Django is supported by an independent foundation established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. Like most open-source foundations, the goal of the Django Software Foundation is to promote, support, and advance its open-source project: in our case, the Django Web framework.
</p>

<p>
The foundation's goals are to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Support development of Django by sponsoring sprints, meetups, gatherings and community events.</li>
<li>Promote the use of Django among the world-wide Web development community.</li>
<li>Protect the intellectual property and the framework's long-term viability.</li>
<li>Advance the state of the art in Web development.</li>
</ul>
